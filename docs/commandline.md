# Buckets Commandline
Developer tools for those who want to get closer to the metal.

## Install

Make sure you have installed Buckets globally:

    npm install buckets -g

Now you should be able to acess buckets:

    buckets -v

which would show the current version of buckets. Use

    buckets -h

to see the help and learn about more options.
