# Installing Buckets

There are several ways to install Buckets. The easiest way currently is to install on [Heroku](http://heroku.com/)—as long as you have a Heroku account, you can simply use the button below:

[![Deploy](https://www.herokucdn.com/deploy/button.png)](https://heroku.com/deploy)

Soon, you will also be able to install Buckets as an NPM module. Below are instructions for installing Buckets locally:

### Pre-requirements

[MongoDB](http://www.mongodb.org), [Node.js](http://nodejs.org) and the following global:

```
npm install -g grunt-cli
```

Then install the local Node dependencies:

```
npm install
```

### Running Buckets

At this point, you should be able to run:

```
grunt serve
```

After building, Buckets should then be accessible at the default address: [http://localhost:3000/](http://localhost:3000/)

### Contributing

This is a product being built by the [Assembly](https://assemblymade.com) community. You can help push this idea forward by visiting [https://assemblymade.com/buckets](https://assemblymade.com/buckets). We welcome any contributions to product design/direction or code.

Assembly products are like open-source and made with contributions from the community. Assembly handles the boring stuff like hosting, support, financing, legal, etc. Once the product launches we collect the revenue and split the profits amongst the contributors.

One quick note on adding dependencies: First, you probably shouldn't have to add too many. But if you find yourself needing to `npm install awesome-sauce`, make sure you include either the `--save` flag (if the dependency will be needed in production) or `--save-dev` (if the dependency is only needed for testing/development).
