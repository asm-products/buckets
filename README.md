A fast, simple way to build dynamic websites on top of [Express](http://expressjs.com/), [MongoDB](http://www.mongodb.org/), and [ElasticSearch](http://www.elasticsearch.org/). [More about our vision](docs/vision/vision.md).

# Installing Buckets

There are several ways to install Buckets. Choose the path which is the easiest fit for your development environment.

## Heroku

The easiest way currently is to install on [Heroku](http://heroku.com/)—as long as you have a Heroku account, you can simply use the button below:

[![Deploy](https://www.herokucdn.com/deploy/button.png)](https://heroku.com/deploy)

## NPM

To use Buckets directly from NPM, use:

```
npm install buckets --save
```

To add Buckets to your package.json. From here, you can run Buckets in your script like so:

```
buckets = require('buckets');
buckets({
  templatePath: __dirname + “/templates/“,
  publicPath: __dirname + “/public/“,
  // Additional configuration…
});
```

Note: We aim to provide separate middleware to build into existing Express apps soon.

## From this repo

If you plan on contributing to Buckets' development, you can install Buckets directly from this repo.

### Pre-requirements

[MongoDB](http://www.mongodb.org), [Node.js](http://nodejs.org), [Redis](http://redis.io) and the following global:

```
npm install -g grunt-cli
```

Then install the local Node dependencies:

```
npm install
```

At this point, you should be able to run:

```
grunt serve
```

After building, Buckets should then be accessible at the default address: [http://localhost:3000/](http://localhost:3000/). If you plan on working on Buckets source, you should [check out the other grunt tasks available](docs/frontend.md#grunt-tasks) for `dev` and `test` commands.
